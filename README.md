# Debug me : React todo list
## Goal

Debug and improve this app to have the exact same behavior as this one : https://csb-v2x0nj-iu85p21ei-comicscrip.vercel.app/

There is at least 15 things to change in the code to reproduce a fully-working, bug-free application.

Try to fix the maximum amount of things and take a note for each change you make. 

Some bugs can be quite hard to find, so be sure to test carefully and compare the two versions are behaving (with your console open !) to spot the smallest differences. 

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```
